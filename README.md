# check_docker
This a a nagios/NRPE compatible plugin for checking docker containers. So far you can use it to check

- memory consumption in absolute units (bytes, kb, mb, gb) and as a percentage (0-100%)
  of the container limit.
- CPU usages as a percentage (0-100%) of container limit.
- automatic restarts performed by the docker daemon
- container status, i.e. is it running?
- container health checks are passing?
- uptime, i.e. is it able to stay running for a long enough time?
- image version (experimental!), does the running image match that in
  the remote registry?

This check can communicate with a local docker daemon socket file (default) or with local
or remote docker daemons using secure and non-secure TCP connections.

This plugin requires python 3. It is tested on 3.3 and greater but may work on older
versions of 3.
